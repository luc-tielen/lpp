# Embedded Lua

Small framework for embedding Lua in C / C++ code. Combines the speed of a
natively compiled language like C or C++ with the flexibility of a scripting
language like Lua for an all-round solution.


## TODO

- User friendly stack interface
- Wrapper for free functions
    - Lua => C++
    - C++ => Lua
- Wrapper for objects
    - Lua => C++
    - C++ => Lua


## Licenses

This framework makes use of Lua. Lua is licensed under the MIT
license, just like this project!
